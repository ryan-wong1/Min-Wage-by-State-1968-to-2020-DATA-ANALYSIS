US Minimum Wage by State from 1968 - 2020

Explored dataset from Kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017

You can take a look at the two files included in this respository (Excel and SQL Queries).

The Excel file is identical to the CSV file you can download from the Kaggle link but converted to an XLSX if needed to be explored in a database management system.

The SQL Queries file was created to further explore certain problems relating to Minimum wage data by states in the USA from 1968 - 2020.

I've created a visualization on my Tableau Public profile exploring mainly the first three queries from the SQL Queries file at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryanw/vizzes.
