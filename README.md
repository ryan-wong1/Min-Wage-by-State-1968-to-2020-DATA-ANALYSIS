## Explored dataset from Kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017

## This respository contains two files:
- **Min Wage by State 1968 - 2020 EXCEL.xlsx** = The Excel file is identical to the CSV file you can download from the Kaggle link but converted to an XLSX if needed to be explored in a database management system.
- **Min Wage by State 1968 - 2020 SQL QUERIES.sql** = The SQL Queries file was created by me to further explore certain problems relating to Minimum wage data by states in the USA from 1968 - 2020.

## Tableau Dashboard:
I've created a visualization on my Tableau Public profile exploring mainly the first three queries from the SQL Queries file at
